# infosec**aware**

## Description

infosec**aware** is a portal for discussing matters relating to information security events, issues, sharing experiences and helping to collaboratively resolve issues amongst a community.

This application was developed for the Web Scripting and Application Development module (7WCM0035-0901-2019) 2019/2020, MSc Software Development (online) at University of Hertfordshire.

It features:

  * An interactive messageboard, prioritised by popularity and submission date
  * The ability to retract your identity when posting
  * The ability to limit the audience of your post to select community members
  * Tagging facilities, with the ability to limit search results by tag
  * A sensitivity indicator, displayed above the post: posts marked "top secret" are only viewable by administrators, specified users and the author

## Requirements

* nodejs version 13 is required for ESM loader support and ES2015 language standard & imports
* MongoDB version 3.4 or greater (count, aggregation pipeline features required) - version 4.2 was used in development

## Setup

Edit `/mongoose-setup.js` and adjust the DSN to specify how to connect to your MongoDB instance. Install requirements with:

> `npm install`

Start the application with:

> `npm start`

And connect to http://my.host.name:3000/ to use the application.

On a production system, it would be prudent to proxy the frontend with a web server such as nginx or the Apache project's httpd in order to protect traffic with SSL/TLS.

## Starting the application

To run the application in production mode:

> `npm start`

To run the application in development mode:

> `npm run start-dev`

## Coding style

Please note that server-side code is in ES2015 (ES6) format, for which nodejs 13 is required.

Browser-side code is ES5 format for compatibility; this code resides within `public/isaApp/js/`.
